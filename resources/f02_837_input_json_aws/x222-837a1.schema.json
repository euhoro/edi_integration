  "description": "This X12 Transaction Set contains the format and establishes the data contents of the Health Care Claim Transaction Set (837) for use within the context of an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) environment. This transaction set can be used to submit health care claim billing information, encounter information, or both, from providers of health care services to payers, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It can also be used to transmit health care claims and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of health care services within a specific health care/insurance industry segment.\n\nFor purposes of this standard, providers of health care products or services may include entities such as physicians, hospitals and other medical facilities or suppliers, dentists, and pharmacies, and entities providing medical information to meet regulatory requirements. The payer refers to a third party entity that pays claims or administers the insurance product or benefit or both. For example, a payer may be an insurance company, health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), government agency (Medicare, Medicaid, Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), etc.) or an entity such as a third party administrator (TPA) or third party organization (TPO) that may be contracted by one of those groups. A regulatory agency is an entity responsible, by law or rule, for administering and monitoring a statutory benefits program or a specific health care/insurance industry segment.",

The subpart reported as the Billing Provider MUST always represent the most detailed level of enumeration as determined by the organization health care provider and MUST be the same identifier sent to any trading partner. For additional explanation, see section 1.10.3 Organization Health Care Provider Subpart Presentation.\n- Prior to the NPI compliance date, proprietary identifiers necessary for the receiver to identify the Billing Provider entity are to be reported in the REF segment of Loop ID-2010BB.\n- The Taxpayer Identifying Number (TIN) of the Billing Provider to be used for 1099 purposes must be reported in the REF segment of this loop.\n- The Billing Provider may be an individual only when the health care provider performing services is an independent, unincorporated entity. In these cases, the Billing Provider is the individual whose social security number is used for 1099 purposes. That individual's NPI is reported in NM109, and the individual's Tax Identification Number must be reported in the REF segment of this loop. The individual's NPI must be reported when the individual provider is eligible for an NPI. See section 1.10.1 (Providers who are Not Eligible for Enumeration).\n- When the individual or the organization is not a health care provider and, thus, not eligible to receive an NPI (For example, personal care services, carpenters, etc), the Billing Provider should be the legal entity. However, willing trading partners may agree upon varying definitions. Proprietary identifiers necessary for the receiver to identify the entity are to be reported in the Loop ID-2010BB REF, Billing Provider Secondary Identification segment.

There is no recommended limit to the number of ST-SE transactions within a GS-GE or ISA-IEA. Willing trading partners can agree to set limits higher.\n- For purposes of this documentation, the claim detail information is presented only in the dependent level. Specific claim detail information can be given in either the subscriber or the dependent hierarchical level. Because of this, the claim information is said to \"float.\" Claim information is positioned in the same hierarchical level that describes its owner-participant, either the subscriber or the dependent. In other words, the claim information, Loop ID-2300, is placed following Loop ID-2010BB in the Subscriber Hierarchical Level (HL) when patient information is sent in Loop ID-2010BA of the Subscriber HL. Claim information is placed in the Patient HL when the patient information is sent in Loop ID-2010CA of the Patient HL. When the patient is the subscriber or is considered to be the subscriber, Loop ID-2000C and Loop ID-2010CA are not sent.

Specific claim detail information can be given in either the subscriber or the dependent hierarchical level. Because of this, the claim information is said to \"float.\" Claim information is positioned in the same hierarchical level that describes its owner-participant, either the subscriber or the dependent. In other words, the claim information, Loop ID-2300, is placed following Loop ID-2010BB in the Subscriber Hierarchical Level (HL) when patient information is sent in Loop ID-2010BA of the Subscriber HL. Claim information is placed in the Patient HL when the patient information is sent in Loop ID-2010CA of the Patient HL. When the patient is the subscriber or is considered to be the subscriber, Loop ID-2000C and Loop ID-2010CA are not sent.

Example: 20000101 - 20000107 (1/1/00 to 1/7/00) is used for a 7 day supply where the first day of the drug used by the patient is 1/1/00.

The FRM segment is used to answer specific questions on the form identified in the LQ segment. FRM01 is used to indicate the question being answered. Answers can take one of 4 forms: FRM02 for Yes/No questions, FRM03 for text/uncodified answers, FRM04 for answers which use dates, and FRM05 for answers which are percents. For each FRM01 (question) use a remaining FRM element, choosing the element which has the most appropriate format. One FRM segment is used for each question/answer pair.\n\nThe example below shows how the FRM can be used to answer all the pertinent questions on DMERC form 0802 (LQ*UT*08.02~)."
